# Multilingual Lexical Analyzer

## Overview
This project implements a *Multilingual Lexical Analyzer* capable of processing code written in *Java, **C, and **C++*. It uses a unified approach to handle lexical analysis, which is the first step in the compilation process, converting human-readable source code into machine-executable tokens.

The project is a part of research presented at the *2024 5th Global Conference for Advancement in Technology (GCAT 2024)*, and aims to streamline code compilation by reducing redundancy in lexical analyzers and improving efficiency across diverse programming environments.

## Features
- Tokenizes code for *C, **C++, and **Java* programming languages.
- Handles basic tokens such as *keywords, **identifiers, **operators, **symbols, and **constants*.
- Includes error detection for *lexical errors* and provides early debugging.
- Modular design, enabling easy extension to support additional languages in the future.
